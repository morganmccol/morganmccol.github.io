**CardioFlux Design** was created to organize existing Genetesis brand assets and quickly iterate on new design concepts for CardioFlux software applications.

As the first and only UX designer at the time, I built the entire library out over the course of two years. :)

CardioFlux Design was later ported to Figma for ease of sharing designs cross-platform between myself and new designers on the team. For a deeper look into how this library was tracked through version control prior to switching, visit my post on [Using Sketch with Git](/using-sketch-with-git/).

This library contained color palettes, iconography, components, and layouts. Over 250 symbols were created for use in design and development prototyping.

Design components were recreated in Storybook for developers to use through a shared UI library. Prototype files were provided with Vue.js code templates and component CSS.
